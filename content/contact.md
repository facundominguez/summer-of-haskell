# Contact

The Summer of Haskell is organised by the
[Haskell.org Committee](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell.org_committee).  You
can reach us by sending an email to `committee [AT] haskell.org`.

There is also an IRC channel called `#haskell` on
[libera](https://libera.chat/) where you can ask for help.  More info on our
IRC channels can be <a href="https://www.haskell.org/irc/">found here</a>.
